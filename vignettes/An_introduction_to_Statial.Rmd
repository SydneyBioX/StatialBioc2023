# Overview

There are over 37 trillion cells in the human body, each taking up different forms and functions. The behaviour of these cells can be described by canonical characteristics, but their functions can also dynamically change based on their environmental context, leading to cells with diverse states. Understanding changes in cell state related to their spatial context in the tissue microenvironment is key to understanding how spatial interactions between cells can contributes to human disease. State-of-the-art technologies such as PhenoCycler, IMC, CosMx, Xenium, MERFISH and many others have made it possible to deeply phenotype characteristics of cells in their native environment. This has created the exciting opportunity to identify spatially related changes in cell state in a high-thoughput manner.

## Description

Statial is a Bioconductor package which contains a suite of complementary approaches for identifying changes in cell state and how these changes are associated with cell type localisation. This workshop will introduce new functionality in the Statial package which can:

1)  Model spatial relationships between cells in the context of hierarchical cell lineage structures
2)  Uncover changes in marker expression associated with cell proximities
3)  Identify changes in cell state between distinct tissue environments

### Pre-requisites

It is expected that students will have:

-   Basic knowledge of R syntax
-   Familiarity with SingleCellExperiment and/or SpatialExperiment objects
-   This workshop will not provide an in-depth description of cell-resolution spatial omics technologies

### Participation

While it will be possible for participants to run code as we go through the demonstration, given time constraints, I would encourage them to focus their attention into critiquing when and why modelling the spatial relationships between cells in these ways is appropriate. Questions are welcome both within the workshop and if students choose to work through the workshop independently after the demonstration.

### *R* / *Bioconductor* packages used

While this workshop will focus on the functionality of Statial, it will tangentially touch on other Bioconductor packages we have developed for these technologies such as [spicyR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/spicyR.html), [lisaClust](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/lisaClust.html) and [ClassifyR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ClassifyR.html).

# Workshop

## Installation 
```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("Statial")
```



## Load packages

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(StatialBioc2023)
library(Statial)
library(spicyR)
library(lisaClust)
library(ClassifyR)
library(ggplot2)
library(SpatialExperiment)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggsurvfit)
library(scater)

theme_set(theme_classic())
nCores <- 1  # Feel free to parallelise things if you have the cores to spare.

```

The definitions of cell types and cell states are somewhat ambiguous. We will purposefully skirt the debate of what is a cell type vs cell state. Instead, in this workshop I would ask participants to associate *cell state* terminology to simply mean a varying phenotype (*state*) of a large cluster of similar cells (*cell type*). In this workshop we will examine two analytically distinct changes in cell state:

1.  *A discrete change in state.* Cell types (clusters of cells) are further clustered into sub-clusters. These finer-resolution phenotypes of the cell type are labelled as cell states.\
2.  *A continuous change in state.* The state of a cell type is defined by variation in abundance of a gene or protein.

## The data

To illustrate the functionality of Statial we will use a multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF) dataset profiling tissue from triple-negative breast cancer patients$^1$. This dataset simultaneously quantifies *in situ* expression of 36 proteins in 34 immune rich patients. *Note:* The data contains some "uninformative" probes and the original cohort included 41 patients.

The data is stored in a `SpatialExperiment` object called `kerenSPE`. We can load the data and view some basic characteristics.

```{r}
data("kerenSPE", package = "StatialBioc2023")

# Filter out samples with few immune cells and those without survival information.
kerenSPE <- kerenSPE[,kerenSPE$tumour_type!="cold" & !is.na(kerenSPE$`Survival_days_capped*`)]

kerenSPE
```

As our data is stored in a `SpatialExperiment`, with the `spatialCoords` also stored as a `reducedDim`, we can use `scater` to visualise our data in a lower dimensional embedding and look for image or cluster differences.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}

# Perform dimension reduction using UMAP.
# I have already run this and saved it in kerenSPE so that you can save time.
#
# set.seed(51773)
# kerenSPE <- scater::runUMAP(kerenSPE, exprs_values = "intensities", name = "UMAP")

# UMAP by imageID.
scater::plotReducedDim(kerenSPE, dimred = "UMAP", colour_by = "cellType")
```

**Question**

1.  What does this UMAP tell us?
2.  What are some observations we could make if we coloured by `imageID`?

## Identifying discrete changes in cell state with Kontextual

Cells states can be modelled as subclusters of a broader parent cell population. These subclusters, or states, are typically identified via a hierarchical clustering strategy. By framing cell states as discrete clusters, we are able to explore relationships as follows - cell type A has two states, with state 2 being closer to cell type B.

![Kontext](images/KontextSpace.png){style="width: 4in; border: 0px"}

Here we introduce Kontextual. Kontextual models spatial relationships between cells in the context of hierarchical cell lineage structures. By assessing spatial relationships between pairs of cells in the context of other related cell types, Kontextual provides robust quantification of cell type relationships which are invariant to changes in tissue structure.

<img src="images/Kontextual.png" alt="Kontextual" style="width: 4in`; border: 0px"/>

For the purposes of using `Kontextual` we treat cell states as identified clusters of cells, where larger clusters represent a "parent" cell population, and finer sub-clusters representing a "child" cell population. For example a CD4+ T cell may be considered a child to a larger parent population of T cells. `Kontextual` thus aims to quantify how the localisation patterns of a child population of cells deviate from the spatial behaviour of their parent population, and how that influences the localisation between the child cell state and another cell state.

### Cell type hierarchy

A key input for Kontextual is an annotation of cell type hierarchies. We will need these to organise all the cells present into cell state populations or clusters, e.g. all the different B cell types are put in a vector called bcells.

To make our lives easier, we will start by defining these here. I'm happy to talk about how we use our bioconductor package [treekoR](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/treekoR.html) to define these hierarchies in a data driven way.

```{r}
# Set up cell populations

tumour <- c("Keratin_Tumour", "Tumour")

bcells <- c("B_cell")
tcells <- c("dn_T_cell", "CD4_T_cell", "CD8_T_cell", "Tregs")
myeloid <- c("Dc_or_Mono", "DC", "Mono_or_Neu", "Macrophages", "Other_Immune", "Neutrophils")

endothelial <- c("Endothelial")
mesenchymal <- c("Mesenchymal")

tissue <- c(endothelial, mesenchymal)
immune <- c(bcells, tcells, myeloid, "NK") 

all <- c(tumour, tissue, immune, "Unidentified")





```

### Discrete cell state changes within a single image

Here we examine an image highlighted in the Keren et al. 2018 manuscript where the relationship between two cell types depends on a parent cell population. In image 6 of the Keren et al. dataset, we can see that *p53+ tumour cells* and *immune cells* are dispersed. However when the behaviour of *p53+ tumour cells* are placed in the context of the spatial behaviour of its broader parent population *tumour cells*, *p53+ tumour cells* and *immune* would appear localised.

```{r, fig.width=5.5, fig.height=3.5}


# Lets define a new cell type vector
kerenSPE$cellTypeNew <- kerenSPE$cellType

# Select for all cells that express higher than baseline level of p53
p53Pos = assay(kerenSPE)["p53",] > -0.300460

# Find p53+ tumour cells
kerenSPE$cellTypeNew[kerenSPE$cellType %in% tumour] <- "Tumour"
kerenSPE$cellTypeNew[p53Pos & kerenSPE$cellType %in% tumour] <- "p53_Tumour"

#Group all immune cells under the name "Immune"

kerenSPE$cellTypeNew[kerenSPE$cellType %in% immune] <- "Immune"


# Plot image 6

kerenSPE |>
  colData() |>
  as.data.frame() |>
  filter(imageID == "6") |>
  filter(cellTypeNew %in% c("Immune", "Tumour", "p53_Tumour")) |>
  arrange(cellTypeNew) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, color = cellTypeNew)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#505050", "#64BC46","#D6D6D6")) + guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Cell types", override.aes = list(size=3)))

```

The `Kontextual` function accepts a `SingleCellExperiment` object, or a single image, or list of images from a `SingleCellExperiment` object, this gets passed into the `cells` argument. The two cell types which will be evaluated are specified in the `to` and `from` arguments. A parent population must also be specified in the `parent` argument, note the parent cell population must include the `to` cell type. The argument `r` will specify the radius which the cell relationship will be evaluated on. `Kontextual` supports parallel processing, the number of cores can be specified using the `cores` argument. `Kontextual` can take a single value or multiple values for each argument and will test all combinations of the arguments specified.

We can calculate these relationships for a single radius.

```{r}
p53_Kontextual <- Kontextual(
  cells = kerenSPE,
  image = 6,
  r = 50,
  from = "p53_Tumour",
  to = "Immune",
  parent = c("p53", "Tumour"),
  cellType = "cellTypeNew"
)

p53_Kontextual

```

The `kontextCurve` calculates the L-function value and Kontextual values over a range of radii. While `kontextPlot` plots these values. If the points lie above the red line (expected pattern) then localisation is indicated for that radius, if the points lie below the red line then dispersion is indicated. As seen in the following plot Kontextual is able to correctly identify localisation between p53+ tumour cells and immune cells in the example image for a certain range of radii. The original L-function is not able to identify localisation at any value of radii.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}

curves <- kontextCurve(
  cells = kerenSPE,
  image = "6",
  from = "p53_Tumour",
  to = "Immune",
  parent = c("p53+Tumour", "Tumour"),
  rs = seq(10, 510, 100),
  cellType = "cellTypeNew",
  cores = nCores
)

kontextPlot(curves)
```

Alternatively all pairwise cell relationships and their corresponding parents in the dataset can be tested. A data frame with all pairwise combinations can be creating using the `parentCombinations` function. This function takes in a vector of all the cells, as well as all the parent vectors set up earlier. As shown below the output is a data frame specifying the `to`, `from`, and `parent` arguments for `Kontextual`.

```{r}
# Get all relationships between cell types and their parents
parentDf <- parentCombinations(
  all = all,
  tumour,
  bcells,
  tcells,
  myeloid,
  endothelial,
  mesenchymal,
  tissue,
  immune
)

```

### Discrete cell state changes across all images

Rather than specifying `to`, `from`, and `parent` in Kontextual, the output from `parentCombinations` can be input into `Kontextual` using the `parentDf` argument, to examine all pairwise relationships in the dataset. This chunk will take a signficant amount of time to run (\~20 minutes), for demonstration the results have been saved and are loaded in.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Running Kontextual on all relationships across all images.
kerenKontextual <- Kontextual(
  cells = kerenSPE,
  parentDf = parentDf,
  r = 50,
  cores = nCores
)
```

```{r}
data("kerenKontextual", package = "StatialBioc2023")
bigDiff <- (kerenKontextual$original - kerenKontextual$kontextual)
head(kerenKontextual[order(bigDiff),], 10)
```

### Associate discrete state changes with survival outcomes

To examine whether the features obtained from `Statial` are associated with patient outcomes or groupings, we can use the `colTest` function from `SpicyR`. To understand if survival outcomes differ significantly between 2 patient groups, specify `type = "survival"` in `colTest`. Here we examine which features are most associated with patient survival using the Kontextual values as an example. To do so, survival data is extracted from `kerenSPE` and converted into the survival object `kerenSurv`.

```{r}

# Extracting survival data
survData = kerenSPE |>
    colData() |> 
    data.frame() |> 
    select(imageID, Survival_days_capped., Censored) |> 
    unique()

# Creating survival vector
kerenSurv = Surv(survData$Survival_days_capped, survData$Censored)
names(kerenSurv) = survData$imageID

```

In addition to this, the Kontextual results must be converted from a `data.frame` to a wide `matrix`, this can be done using `prepMatrix`. Note, to extract the original L-function values, specify `column = "original"` in `prepMatrix`.

```{r}
# Converting Kontextual result into data matrix
kontextMat = prepMatrix(kerenKontextual)

# Ensuring rownames of kontextMat match up with rownames of the survival vector 
kontextMat = kontextMat[names(kerenSurv), ]

# Replace NAs with 0
kontextMat[is.na(kontextMat )] <- 0

```

Finally, both the Kontextual matrix and survival object are passed into `colTest`, with `type = "survival"` to obtain the survival results.

```{r}
# Running survival analysis
survivalResults = spicyR::colTest(kontextMat, kerenSurv, type = "survival")


head(survivalResults)

```

As we can see from the results `Mesenchymal__Macrophages__tissue` is the most significant pairwise relationship which contributes to patient survival. That is the relationship between Mesenchymal cells and macrophage cells, relative to the parent population of all tissue cells. We can see that there is a negative coefficient associated with this relationship, which tells us a decrease in localisation of Mesenchymal and Macrophages leads to poorer survival outcomes for patients.

The association between `Mesenchymal__Macrophages__tissue` and survival can also be visualised on a Kaplan-Meier curve. We must first extract the Kontextual values of this relationship across all images. Next we determine if Mesenchymal and Macrophages are relatively attracted or avoiding in each image, by comparing the Kontextual value in each image to the median Kontextual value. Finally we plot the Kaplan-Meier curve using the `ggsurvfit` package.

As shown below, when Mesenchymal and Macrophages are relatively more dispersed to one another, patients tend to have worse survival outcomes.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
# Selecting most significant relationship
survRelationship = kontextMat[["Mesenchymal__Macrophages__tissue"]]
survRelationship = ifelse(survRelationship > median(survRelationship), "Localised", "Dispersed")
    
# Plotting Kaplan-Meier curve
survfit2(kerenSurv ~ survRelationship) |>
    ggsurvfit() +
    add_pvalue() +
    ggtitle("Mesenchymal__Macrophages__tissue")
```

## Identifying continuous changes in cell state

Changes in cell states can be analytically framed as the change in abundance of a gene or protein within a particular cell type. We can analytically determine whether continuous changes occur to a cell's state as changes occur in its spatial proximity to another cell type. In the figures below we see the expression of a marker increased in cell type A as it grows closer in spatial proximity to cell type B. This can then be quantified with a scatterplot to determine statistical significance. In the next section of this workshop, we will be exploring the analytical functionalities of Statial which can uncover these continuous changes in cell state.

<img src="images/ctsCombined.jpg" alt="ctsCombined" style="border: 0px"/>

### Continuous cell state changes within a single image.

The first step in analysing these changes is to calculate the spatial proximity (`getDistances`) and abundance (`getAbundances`) of each cell to every cell type. These values will then be stored in the `reducedDims` slot of the `SpatialExperiment` object under the names `distances` and `abundances` respectively.

```{r}

kerenSPE <- getDistances(kerenSPE,
                    maxDist = 200)

kerenSPE <- getAbundances(kerenSPE,
                     r = 50)

```

First, let's examine the same effect observed earlier with Kontextual. To avoid redefining cell types we'll examine the distance between p53-positive tumour cells and macrophages in the context of total keratin/tumour cells for image 6.

Statial provides two main functions to assess this relationship - `calcStateChanges` and `plotStateChanges`. We can use `calcStateChanges` to examine the relationship between 2 cell types for 1 marker in a specific image. Similar to `Kontextual`, we can specify the two cell types with the `to` and `from` arguments, and the marker of interest with the `marker` argument. We can appreciate that the `fdr` statistic for this relationship is significant, and with a negative `coef`, or coefficient value, indicating that the expression of p53 in keratin/tumour cells decreases as distance from macrophages increases.

```{r}

stateChanges <- calcStateChanges(
  cells = kerenSPE,
  type = "distances",
  image = "6",
  from = "Keratin_Tumour",
  to = "Macrophages",
  marker = "p53")

stateChanges
```

Statial provides a convenient function for visualising this relationship - `plotStateChanges`. Similar to `Kontextual` and `calcStateChanges`, we can specify the cell types to be evaluated with the `to` and `from` arguments and the marker of interest with `marker`.

Through this analysis, we can observe that keratin/tumour cells closer to a group of macrophages tend to have higher expression of p53, as observed in the first graph. This relationship is quantified with the second graph, showing an overall decrease of p53 expression in keratin/tumour cells as distance to macrophages increase.

These results allow us to essentially arrive at the same result as Kontextual, which calculated a localisation between p53+ keratin/tumour cells and macrophages in the wider context of keratin/tumour cells.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
p <- plotStateChanges(
  cells = kerenSPE,
  type = "distances",
  image = "6",
  from = "Keratin_Tumour",
  to = "Macrophages",
  marker = "p53",
  size = 1,
  shape = 19,
  interactive = FALSE,
  plotModelFit = FALSE,
  method = "lm")

p

```

::: question
**Question**

1.  What information does this form of analysis provide that Kontextual does not?
2.  Is this observation of localisation consistent across images?
3.  Can you find an interaction where the coefficient is positive? i.e. marker expression in the `to` cell type rises as distances increases from the `from` cell type.
:::

### Continuous cell state changes across all images.

Beyond looking at single cell-to-cell interactions for a single image, we can also look at all interactions across all images. The `calcStateChanges` function provided by Statial can be expanded for this exact purpose - by not specifying cell types, a marker, or an image, `calcStateChanges` will examine the most significant correlations between distance and marker expression across the entire dataset. Here, we've calculated all state changes across all images in case you would like to have a play, but first we'll be taking a closer examination at the most significant interactions found within image 6 of the Keren et al. dataset.

```{r}
stateChanges <- calcStateChanges(
  cells = kerenSPE,
  type = "distances",
  minCells = 100)

stateChanges |> 
  filter(imageID == 6) |>
  head(n = 10)
```

In image 6, the majority of the top 10 most significant interactions occur between keratin/tumour cells and an immune population, and many of these interactions appear to involve the HLA class I ligand.

We can examine some of these interactions further with the `plotStateChanges` function. Taking a closer examination of the relationship between macrophages and keratin/tumour HLA class I expression, the plot below shows us a clear visual correlation - as macrophage density increases, keratin/tumour cells increase their expression HLA class I.

Biologically, HLA Class I is a ligand which exists on all nucleated cells, tasked with presenting internal cell antigens for recognition by the immune system, marking aberrant cells for destruction by either CD8+ T cells or NK cells.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}

p <- plotStateChanges(
  cells = kerenSPE,
  type = "distances",
  image = "6",
  from = "Keratin_Tumour",
  to = "Macrophages",
  marker = "HLA_Class_1",
  size = 1,
  shape = 19,
  interactive = FALSE,
  plotModelFit = FALSE,
  method = "lm")

p

```

Now, we can take a look at the top 10 most significant results across all images.

```{r}

stateChanges |> head(n = 10)

```

Immediately, we can appreciate that a couple of interactions appear a bit strange. One of the most significant interactions occurs between B cells and CD4 T cells, where CD4 T cells are found to increase in CD20 expression when in close proximity to B cells. Biologically, CD20 is a highly specific ligand for B cells, and under healthy circumstances are usually not expressed in T cells.

Could this potentially be an artefact of `calcStateChanges`? We can examine the image through the `plotStateChanges` function, where we indeed observe an apparent localisation between B cells and T cells.

::: question
**Question**

1.  Are there any other interactions here that you think might not make biological sense?\

2.  Does the relationship between T cell CD20 expression and B cell proximity occur across images?\

3.  Why are the majority of most significant interactions occurring in image 35?

    HINT: Configure the parameters of `plotStateChanges` to examine some these other significant interactions. Do they look like artefacts?
:::

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}

p <- plotStateChanges(
  cells = kerenSPE,
  type = "distances",
  image = "35",
  from = "CD4_T_cell",
  to = "B_cell",
  marker = "CD20",
  size = 1,
  shape = 19,
  interactive = FALSE,
  plotModelFit = FALSE,
  method = "lm")

p

```

So why are T cells expressing CD20? This brings us to a key limitation of cell segmentation.

### Contamination (Lateral marker spill over)

Contamination, or more specifically known as lateral marker spill over, is an issue that results in a cell's marker expressions being wrongly attributed to another adjacent cell. This issue arises from incorrect segmentation where components of one cell are wrongly determined as belonging to another cell. Alternatively, this issue can arise when antibodies used to tag and measure marker expressions do not latch on properly to a cell of interest, thereby resulting in residual markers being wrongly assigned as belonging to a cell near the intended target cell. It is important that we either correct or account for this incorrect attribution of markers in our modelling process. This is critical in understanding whether significant cell-cell interactions detected are an artifact of technical measurement errors driven by spill over or are real biological changes that represent a shift in a cell's state.

<img src="images/Contamination.png" alt="Contamination" style="width: 4in; border: 0px"/>

To circumvent this problem, Statial provides a function that predicts the probability that a cell is any particular cell type - `calcContamination`. `calcContamination` returns a dataframe of probabilities demarcating the chance of a cell being any particular cell type. This dataframe is stored under `contaminations` in the `reducedDim` slot of the `SpatialExperiment` object. It also provides the `rfMainCellProb` column, which provides the probability that a cell is indeed the cell type it has been designated. E.g. For a cell designated as a CD8+ T cell, rfMainCellProb could give a 80% chance that the cell is indeed CD8+ T cell, due to contamination.

We can then introduce these probabilities as covariates into our linear model by setting `contamination = TRUE` as a parameter in our `calcStateChanges` function. However, this is not a perfect solution for the issue of contamination. As we can see, despite factoring in contamination into our linear model, the correlation between B cell density and CD20 expression in CD4+ T cells remains one of the most significant interactions in our model.

```{r}
kerenSPE <- calcContamination(kerenSPE)

stateChangesCorrected <- calcStateChanges(
  cells = kerenSPE,
  type = "distances",
  minCells = 100,
  contamination = TRUE)

stateChangesCorrected |> head(n = 20)

```

However, this does not mean factoring in contamination into our linear model was ineffective. In general, cell type specific markers such as CD68, CD45, and CD20 should not change in cells they are not specific to. Therefore, relationships detected to be significant involving these cell type markers are likely false positives and will be treated as such for the purposes of evaluation.

Plotting the relationship between false positives and true positives, we'd expect the contamination correction to be greatest in relationships which are detected to be more significant.

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
cellTypeMarkers <- c("CD3", "CD4", "CD8", "CD56", "CD11c", "CD68", "CD45", "CD20")

values = c("blue", "red")
names(values) <- c("None", "Corrected")

df <- rbind(data.frame(TP =cumsum(stateChanges$marker %in% cellTypeMarkers), FP = cumsum(!stateChanges$marker %in% cellTypeMarkers), type = "None"),
            data.frame(TP =cumsum(stateChangesCorrected$marker %in% cellTypeMarkers), FP = cumsum(!stateChangesCorrected$marker %in% cellTypeMarkers), type = "Corrected"))

ggplot(df, aes(x = TP, y = FP, colour = type)) + geom_line()+ labs(y = "Cell state marker", x = "Cell type marker") + scale_colour_manual(values = values)
```

Here, we zoom in on the ROC curve where the top 100 lowest p values occur, where we indeed see more true positives than false positives with contamination correction.

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
ggplot(df, aes(x = TP, y = FP, colour = type)) + geom_line()+ xlim(0,100) + ylim(0,1000)+ labs(y = "Cell state marker", x = "Cell type marker") + scale_colour_manual(values = values)
            

```

::: question
**Question**

1.  What can we conclude from the above ROC graphs?
:::

### Associate continuous state changes with survival outcomes

Similiar to `Kontextual`, we can run a similar survival analysis using our state changes results. Here, `prepMatrix` extracts the coefficients, or the `coef` column of `stateChanges` by default. To use the t values instead, specify `column = "tval"` in the `prepMatrix` function.

```{r}
# Preparing features for Statial
stateMat <- prepMatrix(stateChanges)

# Ensuring rownames of stateMat match up with rownames of the survival vector
stateMat <- stateMat[names(kerenSurv), ]

# Remove some very small values
stateMat <- stateMat[,colMeans(abs(stateMat)>0.0001)>.8]

For our state changes results, `Keratin_Tumour__Mesenchymal__HLA_Class_1` is the most significant pairwise relationship which contributes to patient survival. That is, the relationship between HLA class I expression in keratin/tumour cells and their spatial proximity to mesenchymal cells. As there is a negative coeffcient associated with this relationship, which tells us that higher HLA class I expression in keratin/tumour cells nearby mesenchymal cell populations lead to poorer survival outcomes for patients.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
# Selecting the most significant relationship
survRelationship = stateMat[["Keratin_Tumour__Mesenchymal__HLA_Class_1"]]
survRelationship = ifelse(survRelationship > median(survRelationship), "Higher expressed in close cells", "Lower expressed in close cells")
    
# Plotting Kaplan-Meier curve

**Question**

1.  How should these coefficients be interpreted?
2.  Do any of these relationships makes sense?
3.  Could you visualise representative images?

## Continuous cell state changes within spatial domains

We can look at changes of cell state relative to membership of different spatial domains. These domains can represent distinct tissue microenvironments where cells will potentially be interacting with different types cells.

<img src="images/region.png" alt="cts1" style="width: 70%; border: 0px"/>

Here we see the abundance of a marker being higher in cell type 2 within spatial region 1 than spatial region 2.

### Identify spatial domains with lisaClust

We can cluster areas with similar spatial interactions to identify regions using the `lisaClust` package on Bioconductor. Here we set `k = 5` to identify 5 regions.

```{r}
set.seed(51773)

# Preparing features for lisaClust
kerenSPE <- lisaClust::lisaClust(kerenSPE, k = 5)

```

The regions identified by lisaClust can be visualised using the `hatchingPlot` function.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=6.5}
# Use hatching to visualise regions and cell types.
lisaClust::hatchingPlot(kerenSPE,
  useImages = "5",
  line.spacing = 41, # spacing of lines
  nbp = 100 # smoothness of lines
) 

```

### Changes in marker means

`Statial` provides functionality to identify the average marker expression of a given cell type in a given region, using the `getMarkerMeans` function. Similar to the analysis above, these features can also be used for survival analysis.

```{r lisaClust}

cellTypeRegionMeans <- getMarkerMeans(kerenSPE,
                              imageID = "imageID",
                              cellType = "cellType",
                              region = "region")

survivalResults = colTest(cellTypeRegionMeans[names(kerenSurv),], kerenSurv, type = "survival")

head(survivalResults)

```

## Patient classification

Finally we demonstrate how we can use the Bioconductor package `ClassifyR` to perform patient classification with the features generated from `Statial`. In addition to the kontextual, state changes, and marker means values, we also calculate cell type proportions and region proportions using the `getProp` function in `spicyR`. Here we perform 5 fold cross validation with 20 repeats, using a CoxPH model for survival classification.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

# Calculate cell type and region proportions
cellTypeProp <- getProp(kerenSPE, 
                       feature = "cellType",
                       imageID = "imageID")
regionProp <- getProp(kerenSPE, 
                       feature = "region",
                       imageID = "imageID")

# Combine all the features into a list for classification 
featureList <- list(states = stateMat, 
                     kontextual = kontextMat,
                     regionMarkerMeans = cellTypeRegionMeans,
                     cellTypeProp = cellTypeProp,
                     regionProp = regionProp)

# Ensure the rownames of the features match the order of the survival vector
featureList <- lapply(featureList, function(x)x[names(kerenSurv),])


set.seed(51773)

kerenCV = crossValidate(
  measurements = featureList,
  outcome = kerenSurv,
  classifier = "CoxPH",
  selectionMethod  = "CoxPH",
  nFolds = 5,
  nFeatures = 10,
  nRepeats = 20
  )

```

Here, we use the `performancePlot` function to assess the C-index from each repeat of the 5-fold cross-validation. We can see that in this case cell type proportions are not a reliable predictor of survival. However the proportion of each spatial domain region in an image or the states estimated by Kontextual could be.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
# Calculate AUC for each cross-validation repeat and plot.
performancePlot(kerenCV,
  characteristicsList = list(x = "Assay Name")
  ) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1))
```
